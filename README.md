# Formations classification

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

What if we at any time can start our football tactics ever ongoing discussion knowing the type of formation?
This is an attempt to automaticaly classify the formation of a football team provided by a picture of them playing.

## Background

It is often a problem to understand which formation a football team uses at a specific game. Sometimes it even changes between offense and defense.


## How is it used?

This solution can decide which class of formation a team has from the input of a picture. Different classes of formations are 4-3-3, 4-4-2, 3-5-2 etc. If you quickly can decide the formation you can then continue your tactical analyze of the game.

## Data sources and AI methods
There are several classification methods that could be in use here, stretching from nearest neighbour to a regression method.
Data is hopefully feeded from league websites.

## What next?
Covering Bandy formations are just behind the corner.
